# Blocked Samples

[Blocked Samples](https://github.com/s3yonsei/blocked_samples) is a profiling technique based on sampling, that encompasses both on- and off-CPU events simultaneously. Based on blocked samples, we present two profiler: *bperf*, an easy-to-use sampling-based profiler and *BCOZ*, a causal profiler that profiles both on- and off-CPU events simultaneously and estimates potential speedup of optimizations.

This repository consists of three subdirectories: bcoz (source code of BCOZ), blocked\_samples (source code of Linux kernel with bperf), osdi24\_ae (OSDI'24 artifacts evaluation).
