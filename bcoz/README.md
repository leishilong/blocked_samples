## BCOZ

[BCOZ](https://github.com/s3yonsei/bcoz) is a causal profiler that leverages the concept of virtual speedup for both on-/off-CPU events using blocked samples. At its core, BCOZ utilizes on- and off-CPU events profiles collected by blocked samples and estimates performance improvement through virtual speedup.



BCOZ is built on top of [COZ](https://github.com/plasma-umass/coz) (SOSP'15)

For the detailed description, please refer to the paper:
