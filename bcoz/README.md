## BCOZ

[BCOZ](https://github.com/s3yonsei/bcoz) is a causal profiler that leverages the concept of virtual speedup for both on-/off-CPU events using blocked samples. At its core, BCOZ utilizes on- and off-CPU events profiles collected by blocked samples and estimates performance improvement through virtual speedup.

BCOZ is built on top of [COZ](https://github.com/plasma-umass/coz) (SOSP'15).

Please follow the instructions in [Getting Started with Blocked Samples](https://github.com/s3yonsei/blocked_samples/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started-with-blocked-samples) to use BCOZ.
