## 1. Introduction

This repository is for reproduce the experimental results presented in the paper published at OSDI'24. Our evaluations are consists of 'motivational', 'RocksDB (*prefix\_dist*, *allrandom*, *fillrandom*)', 'NPB (*integer sort*)', and 'overhead'.

We recommend that follow the instructions below after you complete the [Getting Started with Blocked Samples](https://github.com/s3yonsei/blocked_samples/).

* #### Motivational - Figure 7, 9
* #### RocksDB-*prefix\_dist* (Section 4.2 - Optimization 1) - Figure 10
* #### RocksDB-*allrandom* (Section 4.2 - Optimization 2) - Figure 12a, 12b
* #### RocksDB-*fillrandom* (Section 4.3 - Optimization 3) - Figure 13b, 13c, 14
* #### NPB - Figure 15
* #### Overhead - Figure 16, 17


## 2. Artifacts components

Blocked samples is consists of two main components: Linux perf subsystem (Linux kernel), and BCOZ source codes (bperf is included in Linux kernel). Both are maintained in *bcoz* and *blocked\_samples* directories in this repository, respectively (https://github.com/s3yonsei/blocked_samples).

## 3. Configurations

| **Component** | **Specification**                  |
|---------------|------------------------------------|
| Processor     | Intel Xeon Gold 5218 2.30 GHz * 2, 32 physical cores |
| **SSD**       | |
| Memory        | DDR4 2933 MHz, 384 GB (32 GB x 12)  |
| **OS**        | Ubuntu 20.04 Server |

Note that, to evaluate our artifacts, not all system configurations are mendatory. However,
